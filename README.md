# TronGame
implementation of Tron game Agent using minimax and genetics algorithm
the graphics are implemented using unity , you need to install chillin-monitor needed libraries before running the game.
the algorithm we use for this game is a combination of minimax and genetics algorithm such as we use minimax algorithm as 
fitness function for the genetics algorithm. each cycle of the game can take up to 8 sec so due to our world size we can 
build our minimax tree with depth 6 at most.

a view of the game is shown above:
